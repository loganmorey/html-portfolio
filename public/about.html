<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Logan Morey. I am an aspiring web developer, who is currently taking class on Udemy.com to learn all the three stacks in web development. My current job title is a team leader in one of the country's largest water heater manufacturer.
  I work extremely well with others and have very strong leadership skills. 
  I currently spend my freetime taking classes and doing projects to further expand my knowledge. I also enjoy spending time with daughter outdoors, going swimming, and riding bikes. 
  As I continue to gain knowledge in this field I am wanting to get in somewhere with an entry level position and gain experience on the job working solo, and with a team.
